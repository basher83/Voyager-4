## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Cognee MCP Integration**: Ensure Cognee MCP server is configured and running
2. **Knowledge Graph Data**: Have your codebase analyzed and stored in the knowledge graph
3. **Template Engine**: The Cognee template engine should be properly configured

### Basic Usage

#### 1. Using the Template Renderer

```python
from templates.cognee_powered.template_renderer import CogneeTemplateRenderer

# Initialize the renderer
renderer = CogneeTemplateRenderer()

# Render a template with context
context = {
    'CONTEXT': 'E-commerce platform analysis',
    'SCOPE': 'full_codebase',
    'FOCUS': 'scalability',
    'AUDIENCE': 'development_team'
}

result = await renderer.render_template(
    category='architecture-aware',
    context=context,
    enable_graph_enhancement=True
)

print(result['rendered_content'])
```

#### 2. Direct Engine Usage

```python
from templates.cognee_powered.engine import CogneeTemplateEngine

# Initialize the engine
engine = CogneeTemplateEngine()

# Query knowledge graph directly
graph_result = await engine.query_knowledge_graph(
    query="architectural patterns in microservices",
    search_type="INSIGHTS"
)

# Enhance context with graph insights
enhanced_context = await engine.enhance_context(
    base_context=context,
    template_category='architecture-aware'
)
```

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. Context Preparation

**Provide Rich Context**:
```python
# Good: Rich, specific context
context = {
    'CONTEXT': 'E-commerce checkout service in microservices architecture',
    'SCOPE': 'checkout_service',
    'FOCUS': 'performance_optimization',
    'AUDIENCE': 'senior_development_team',
    'BUSINESS_PRIORITY': 'conversion_rate_improvement'
}

# Avoid: Vague, minimal context
context = {
    'CONTEXT': 'service analysis',
    'SCOPE': 'service'
}
```

**Match Context to Template Category**:
- Architecture-aware: Focus on structural and design aspects
- Context-enriched: Include business goals and stakeholder needs  
- Relationship-informed: Specify target components and change types
- Pattern-adaptive: Include team and project characteristics
- Dynamic-enhanced: Define success metrics and optimization goals

### 2. Template Selection

**Start Simple, Scale Up**:
1. Begin with basic templates for straightforward tasks
2. Use enhanced templates for complex analysis
3. Apply dynamic templates for production systems

**Consider Performance vs. Quality Trade-offs**:
- Simple variants: Faster responses, basic analysis
- Full templates: Comprehensive analysis, longer processing time
- Efficiency-optimized variants: Balanced approach

### 3. Knowledge Graph Preparation

**Ensure Quality Data**:
- Keep knowledge graph updated with latest code changes
- Include comprehensive codebase coverage
- Maintain business context and documentation

**Optimize for Your Use Cases**:
- Focus graph content on your primary analysis needs
- Include team conventions and standards
- Document architectural decisions and patterns

### 4. Performance Optimization

**Use Caching Effectively**:
```python
# Templates automatically cache graph queries
# Adjust cache duration based on code change frequency
engine = CogneeTemplateEngine()
engine.config['performance']['cache_duration'] = 3600  # 1 hour for active development
```

**Batch Processing for Efficiency**:
```python
# Process multiple templates together
render_configs = [
    {'category': 'architecture-aware', 'context': context1},
    {'category': 'pattern-adaptive', 'context': context2}
]

batch_results = await renderer.batch_render_templates(render_configs)
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Template Not Found
```
FileNotFoundError: Template not found: category/template.md
```
**Solution**: Verify template category and filename are correct. Use `list_available_templates()` to see available options.

#### 2. Cognee Connection Issues
```
Warning: Cognee not available. Using mock data.
```
**Solution**: Ensure Cognee MCP server is running and accessible. Check network connectivity and authentication.

#### 3. Knowledge Graph Empty Results
```
No relevant information found in knowledge graph.
```
**Solution**: Verify your codebase has been analyzed and stored in the knowledge graph. Check query specificity and graph data quality.

#### 4. Performance Issues
```
Template rendering taking >120 seconds
```
**Solution**: 
- Enable caching in configuration
- Use simpler template variants for faster results
- Optimize knowledge graph queries
- Consider batch processing for multiple requests

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# This will show detailed information about:
# - Knowledge graph queries and results
# - Template rendering steps
# - Performance metrics
# - Cache hit/miss information
```

## üìà Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Rendering Performance**:
   - Template rendering time
   - Knowledge graph query time
   - Success rate of completions

2. **Quality Metrics**:
   - Pattern recognition accuracy
   - Context relevance scores
   - User satisfaction ratings

3. **System Health**:
   - Cache hit rates
   - Error frequencies
   - Resource utilization

### Monitoring Dashboard

Access performance statistics:

```python
engine = CogneeTemplateEngine()
stats = engine.get_performance_stats()

print("Performance Statistics:")
for operation, metrics in stats.items():
    print(f"  {operation}:")
    print(f"    Average duration: {metrics['avg_duration']:.2f}s")
    print(f"    Total operations: {metrics['count']}")
```
