# Codebase Overview - Base Template

You are analyzing a codebase to provide an architectural overview for developers who need to understand the project structure and design patterns.

## Context
This analysis will be used by:
- New team members joining the project
- Developers working on integrations
- Technical stakeholders making architectural decisions

## Instructions

1. **Examine the project structure** and identify the main components and directories
2. **Identify the architectural pattern** (MVC, microservices, component-based, etc.)
3. **List key technologies and frameworks** used in the project
4. **Describe the main modules/components** and their responsibilities
5. **Note any significant design decisions** or architectural choices
6. **Highlight important files and directories** that new developers should know about

## Output Format

Provide your analysis in this structured format:

```markdown
## Architecture Overview

**Pattern**: [Architectural pattern used]

**Technologies**: [List of main technologies and frameworks]

**Key Components**:
- [Component/Directory]: [Description of purpose and responsibility]
- [Component/Directory]: [Description of purpose and responsibility]
- [Component/Directory]: [Description of purpose and responsibility]

**Important Files**:
- [File]: [Purpose and significance]
- [File]: [Purpose and significance]

**Design Decisions**: [Notable architectural choices and their rationale]
```

## Requirements

- Be specific about technologies and versions when identifiable
- Focus on the overall structure rather than implementation details  
- Use clear, technical language appropriate for developers
- Organize information logically from high-level to specific
- Highlight patterns and conventions used throughout the codebase
