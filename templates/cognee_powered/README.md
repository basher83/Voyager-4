# Cognee-Powered Templates

This directory contains AI-enhanced templates that leverage knowledge graph intelligence through the Cognee integration. These templates extend the traditional prompt engineering hierarchy with semantic understanding, relationship awareness, and adaptive intelligence.

## 🧠 Knowledge Graph Intelligence

Cognee-powered templates integrate with the knowledge graph to provide:

- **Semantic Understanding**: Templates understand the deeper meaning and context of code
- **Relationship Awareness**: Templates leverage connections between code components
- **Pattern Recognition**: Templates adapt based on discovered architectural patterns
- **Dynamic Enhancement**: Templates improve based on usage patterns and feedback
- **Context Enrichment**: Templates automatically include relevant background information

## 🏗️ Template Categories

### 1. architecture-aware/ - Code Structure Intelligence
**Templates that understand codebase architecture** through knowledge graph analysis.

**Capabilities:**
- Automatic architectural pattern detection
- Component relationship mapping
- Dependency analysis and visualization
- Design pattern recognition
- Technology stack understanding

**When to use:** Architecture analysis, refactoring decisions, integration planning

**Example queries:**
```python
# Template automatically queries knowledge graph for:
# - Architectural patterns in the codebase
# - Component dependencies and relationships
# - Technology stack and framework usage
```

### 2. context-enriched/ - Semantic Context Enhancement
**Templates with deep semantic understanding** of code purpose and business logic.

**Capabilities:**
- Automatic context injection from knowledge graph
- Business logic understanding
- Cross-component context awareness
- Historical change pattern analysis
- Intent-driven code suggestions

**When to use:** Complex feature development, bug analysis with business context, code review

**Example enhancement:**
```python
# Base template: "Fix this bug"
# Enhanced template: "Fix this bug considering the payment processing workflow,
# user authentication requirements, and error handling patterns used in
# similar components [automatically discovered from knowledge graph]"
```

### 3. relationship-informed/ - Graph Connection Intelligence
**Templates that leverage code relationships** and dependencies from the knowledge graph.

**Capabilities:**
- Impact analysis for changes
- Related component discovery
- Cross-cutting concern identification
- API usage pattern analysis
- Integration point mapping

**When to use:** Impact assessment, integration work, debugging cross-component issues

**Example relationships:**
```python
# Template discovers and uses:
# - Which components depend on the current code
# - What external APIs are used
# - How data flows through the system
# - Which tests cover related functionality
```

### 4. pattern-adaptive/ - Behavior Learning Templates
**Templates that adapt** based on discovered patterns and coding conventions.

**Capabilities:**
- Coding style adaptation
- Pattern consistency enforcement
- Convention adherence
- Team practice learning
- Best practice suggestion

**When to use:** Code generation, style consistency, onboarding new developers

**Adaptive behaviors:**
```python
# Template learns and adapts to:
# - Naming conventions used in the codebase
# - Error handling patterns
# - Testing strategies and structures
# - Documentation styles
# - Code organization preferences
```

### 5. dynamic-enhanced/ - Self-Improving Intelligence
**Templates that evolve** based on usage feedback and success metrics.

**Capabilities:**
- Performance tracking and optimization
- Success pattern learning
- Failure mode detection
- Template version management
- A/B testing integration

**When to use:** Production systems, high-volume usage, continuous improvement

**Enhancement features:**
```python
# Template tracks and improves:
# - Response quality metrics
# - User satisfaction scores
# - Task completion rates
# - Error frequencies
# - Performance benchmarks
```

## 🛠️ Template Structure

Each category follows this enhanced structure:

```
category/
├── README.md                    # Category overview and use cases
├── template.md                  # Base template with Cognee integration
├── engine.py                    # Template rendering engine with graph queries
├── metadata.yaml               # Template metadata and configuration
├── variations/                 # Template variations for different scenarios
│   ├── simple-variant.md       # Simplified version
│   ├── detailed-variant.md     # Comprehensive version
│   └── specialized-variant.md  # Domain-specific version
└── examples/                   # Usage examples with results
    ├── basic-example.md        # Simple usage example
    ├── advanced-example.md     # Complex scenario example
    └── integration-example.md  # Integration with existing tools
```

## 🔄 Template Integration Workflow

**1. Knowledge Graph Query Phase**
```python
# Template queries Cognee knowledge graph for:
graph_context = cognee.search(
    query="codebase architecture patterns",
    search_type="INSIGHTS"
)
```

**2. Context Enhancement Phase**
```python
# Template enriches prompt with discovered context:
enhanced_prompt = template.render(
    base_prompt=user_prompt,
    graph_context=graph_context,
    relationships=related_components
)
```

**3. Adaptive Refinement Phase**
```python
# Template adapts based on discovered patterns:
adaptive_prompt = template.adapt(
    prompt=enhanced_prompt,
    coding_patterns=discovered_patterns,
    team_conventions=learned_conventions
)
```

**4. Dynamic Optimization Phase**
```python
# Template optimizes based on feedback:
optimized_prompt = template.optimize(
    prompt=adaptive_prompt,
    success_metrics=performance_data,
    user_feedback=feedback_scores
)
```

## 📊 Integration with Evaluation System

Cognee-powered templates are fully compatible with the existing evaluation framework:

```yaml
# Enhanced evaluation metrics for Cognee templates:
cognee_metrics:
  graph_utilization: 0.8        # How well template uses graph data
  context_relevance: 0.85       # Relevance of injected context
  relationship_accuracy: 0.9    # Accuracy of relationship usage
  adaptation_effectiveness: 0.75 # Success of pattern adaptation
  enhancement_value: 0.8        # Value added by intelligence features
```

## 🎯 Template Selection Guide

| Task Complexity | Recommended Category | Rationale |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Architecture analysis | architecture-aware | Needs structural understanding |
| Feature development | context-enriched | Requires business context |
| Impact assessment | relationship-informed | Needs dependency analysis |
| Code generation | pattern-adaptive | Should follow conventions |
