# Pattern-Adaptive Templates

Pattern-adaptive templates automatically discover and apply the coding patterns, conventions, and best practices established in your codebase. These templates ensure consistency, maintainability, and alignment with team standards by learning from existing code patterns.

## üéØ Purpose

Pattern-adaptive templates solve the challenge of maintaining consistency across a codebase by:
- **Automatically discovering** coding patterns and conventions used in the project
- **Adapting code generation** to match established style and architectural patterns
- **Enforcing consistency** across new and existing code
- **Learning team preferences** and applying them consistently
- **Evolving with the codebase** as patterns and practices change

## üîç When to Use

### Ideal Scenarios
- **New feature development** that should match existing code patterns
- **Code refactoring** to improve consistency with established patterns
- **Team onboarding** where new developers need to learn and apply team conventions
- **Cross-team collaboration** where consistent patterns are critical
- **Legacy code modernization** that should maintain existing patterns while improving quality

### Specific Use Cases
- Implementing new components that should follow established architectural patterns
- Adding features to existing modules while maintaining coding style consistency
- Generating boilerplate code that matches team conventions
- Refactoring code to improve pattern consistency
- Creating documentation that follows team standards

## üöÄ Key Features

### Pattern Discovery
- **Architectural Pattern Recognition**: Identifies design patterns used in the codebase
- **Coding Style Analysis**: Discovers indentation, naming, and formatting conventions
- **Convention Mapping**: Maps team-specific conventions and practices
- **Best Practice Identification**: Identifies successful patterns worth replicating

### Adaptive Code Generation
- **Style-Aware Generation**: Produces code that matches existing style patterns
- **Convention Compliance**: Ensures all generated code follows team conventions
- **Pattern Integration**: Applies appropriate architectural patterns for new code
- **Consistency Enforcement**: Maintains consistency across the entire codebase

### Quality Assurance
- **Pattern Validation**: Verifies that generated code follows identified patterns
- **Style Checking**: Ensures code meets established style guidelines
- **Convention Verification**: Confirms adherence to team conventions
- **Best Practice Application**: Applies identified best practices appropriately
