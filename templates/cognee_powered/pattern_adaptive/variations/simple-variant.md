### Team Conventions
{{TEAM_CONVENTIONS}}

### Best Practices
{{BEST_PRACTICES}}

## Instructions

1. **Follow discovered patterns** from the knowledge graph above
2. **Apply team conventions** for naming and structure
3. **Implement best practices** identified in the codebase
4. **Ensure consistency** with existing code style

## Output Format

```markdown
## Pattern-Adaptive Implementation

### Pattern Analysis
- **Primary Pattern**: [Main pattern to follow]
- **Naming Convention**: [Naming style discovered]
- **Code Style**: [Style preferences identified]

### Implementation Strategy
1. [Key pattern to apply]
2. [Convention to follow]
3. [Best practice to implement]

### Generated Code
```[language]
// Code that follows discovered patterns
[Pattern-compliant implementation]
```

### Pattern Compliance
- [x] Follows team naming conventions
- [x] Matches code organization patterns
- [x] Implements identified best practices
- [x] Consistent with existing style

### Quality Checks
- **Style**: [Compliance level]
- **Conventions**: [Adherence level] 
- **Patterns**: [Usage appropriateness]
```
