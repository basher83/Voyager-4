## üîÑ Knowledge Graph Integration

### Query Pattern
```python
# Template automatically executes these graph queries:

# 1. Component relationship discovery
relationships = cognee.search(
    query="component dependencies and interactions",
    search_type="CODE"
)

# 2. Integration point mapping
integration_points = cognee.search(
    query="api boundaries and communication patterns",
    search_type="INSIGHTS"
)

# 3. Data flow analysis
data_flows = cognee.search(
    query="data movement and transformation patterns",
    search_type="INSIGHTS"
)

# 4. Cross-cutting concern identification
cross_cutting = cognee.search(
    query="shared functionality and common concerns",
    search_type="GRAPH_COMPLETION"
)
```

### Relationship Analysis Process
```python
# Template analyzes relationships comprehensively:
relationship_context = {
    "direct_dependencies": structural_relationships,
    "functional_relationships": feature_relationships,
    "integration_patterns": api_relationships,
    "data_dependencies": data_flow_relationships,
    "cross_cutting_analysis": shared_concerns
}
```
