# Context-Enriched Templates

Templates with deep semantic understanding of code purpose and business logic. These templates automatically inject relevant context from the knowledge graph to provide comprehensive understanding beyond just code structure.

## üß† Semantic Context Intelligence

### Deep Context Understanding
- **Business Logic Comprehension**: Understanding the "why" behind code decisions
- **Cross-Component Context**: How different parts of the system relate functionally
- **Historical Context**: Evolution of features and design decisions over time
- **Domain Knowledge Integration**: Industry-specific patterns and requirements

### Automatic Context Injection
- **Workflow Context**: Understanding business processes and user journeys
- **Feature Relationships**: How features interact and depend on each other
- **Stakeholder Requirements**: User needs and business constraints
- **Integration Context**: How the system fits into larger ecosystems

### Intent-Driven Analysis
- **Purpose Recognition**: Understanding the intended function of code components
- **Business Value Assessment**: Evaluating code changes against business objectives
- **User Impact Analysis**: How changes affect end-user experience
- **Compliance Considerations**: Regulatory and policy implications

## üéØ Use Cases

### Feature Development
Perfect for:
- Planning new feature implementations
- Understanding feature integration requirements

- Identifying cross-cutting concerns

### Bug Analysis with Business Context
Ideal for:
- Understanding impact of bugs on business processes
- Prioritizing fixes based on business criticality
- Analyzing root causes in business workflow context
- Planning comprehensive fixes that consider downstream effects

### Code Review with Semantic Understanding
Excellent for:
- Reviewing changes against business requirements
- Ensuring code aligns with intended functionality
- Validating business logic correctness
- Checking compliance with domain requirements

### Documentation Generation
Great for:
- Creating business-focused technical documentation
- Explaining code behavior in business terms
- Generating user-impact assessments
- Creating stakeholder-friendly technical summaries

## üõ†Ô∏è Template Variables

### Standard Variables
- `{CONTEXT}`: Business and technical background
- `{FEATURE}`: Specific feature or functionality to analyze
- `{SCOPE}`: Analysis scope (feature-level, workflow, integration)
- `{STAKEHOLDERS}`: Target audience for the analysis

### Context-Enriched Variables
- `{BUSINESS_CONTEXT}`: Auto-discovered business logic and workflows
- `{FEATURE_RELATIONSHIPS}`: Feature dependencies and interactions
- `{USER_WORKFLOWS}`: User journeys and process flows
- `{DOMAIN_REQUIREMENTS}`: Industry-specific requirements and constraints
- `{COMPLIANCE_CONTEXT}`: Regulatory and policy considerations
- `{HISTORICAL_CONTEXT}`: Evolution and change history

## üîÑ Knowledge Graph Integration

### Query Pattern
```python
# Template automatically executes these graph queries:

# 1. Business context discovery
business_context = cognee.search(
    query="business logic workflows and processes",
    search_type="GRAPH_COMPLETION"
)

# 2. Feature relationship mapping
feature_relationships = cognee.search(
    query="feature dependencies and user workflows",
    search_type="INSIGHTS"
)

# 3. Domain requirements analysis
domain_requirements = cognee.search(
    query="domain specific requirements and constraints",
    search_type="GRAPH_COMPLETION"
)

# 4. Historical context extraction
historical_context = cognee.search(
    query="feature evolution and change history",
    search_type="INSIGHTS"
)
```

### Context Enhancement Process
```python
# Template enriches prompt with semantic understanding:
semantic_context = {
    "business_workflows": business_context,
    "feature_map": feature_relationships,
    "domain_knowledge": domain_requirements,
    "evolution_history": historical_context,
    "user_impact_analysis": user_insights
}
```
