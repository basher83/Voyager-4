## 📋 Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)

### 1.1 Project Structure & Documentation
- [x] Create ROADMAP.md with progress tracking
- [ ] Build organized directory structure
- [ ] Setup Git repository structure
- [ ] Create initial documentation templates

**Files to Create:**
- `/prompts/` - Organized by use case categories
- `/test-cases/` - Test data and scenarios  
- `/evaluations/` - Evaluation scripts and results
- `/templates/` - Reusable prompt templates
- `/docs/` - Documentation and guides

### 1.2 Knowledge Base Extraction
- [ ] Extract prompt engineering best practices from scraped docs
- [ ] Document Claude 4 specific optimization guidelines
- [ ] Create technique hierarchy reference guide
- [ ] Compile Claude Code SDK usage patterns

**Source Files:**
- `anthropic-md/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/`
- `anthropic-md/en/docs/claude-code/`

### 1.3 Testing Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Install Claude Code SDK (Python/CLI)
- [ ] Configure evaluation tools and dependencies
- [ ] Create automation scripts for batch testing
- [ ] Setup performance monitoring tools

**Progress**: 🟡 25% Complete

---

## 📋 Phase 2: Use Case Analysis & Prompt Categories (Week 1-2)

### 2.1 Define Specific Use Cases
- [ ] Document target use cases with clear success criteria
- [ ] Define metrics for task fidelity and consistency
- [ ] Set performance constraints (latency, cost, accuracy)
- [ ] Create use case priority matrix

### 2.2 Create Prompt Categories
- [ ] **Codebase Understanding**: Overview, architecture analysis, component location
- [ ] **Bug Fixing**: Error diagnosis, solution generation, testing
- [ ] **Code Generation**: Feature implementation, refactoring, documentation
- [ ] **Testing**: Test generation, validation, coverage analysis
- [ ] **Project Management**: PR creation, code review, planning

**Progress**: ⚪ 0% Complete

---

## 📋 Phase 3: Prompt Template Development (Week 2-3)

### 3.1 Build Hierarchical Templates
For each prompt category, create progressive enhancement levels:

- [ ] **Level 1 - Base**: Clear, direct instructions
- [ ] **Level 2 - Enhanced**: + Examples (few-shot prompting)
- [ ] **Level 3 - Advanced**: + Chain of thought reasoning
- [ ] **Level 4 - Structured**: + XML tags for clarity
- [ ] **Level 5 - Specialized**: + Custom system prompts

### 3.2 Claude Code SDK Optimization
- [ ] Implement parallel tool calling prompts
- [ ] Add extended thinking triggers for complex tasks
- [ ] Create session management strategies
- [ ] Optimize for different output formats (JSON, stream-JSON)

**Progress**: ⚪ 0% Complete

---

## 📋 Phase 4: Evaluation System (Week 3)

### 4.1 Multi-Dimensional Testing Framework
- [ ] **Exact Match**: For categorical outputs
- [ ] **Code-based Grading**: For structured responses
- [ ] **LLM-based Evaluation**: For subjective quality assessment
- [ ] **Cosine Similarity**: For consistency testing
- [ ] **Custom Metrics**: For domain-specific requirements

### 4.2 Test Data Generation
- [ ] Create diverse test cases including edge cases
- [ ] Generate synthetic scenarios using Claude
- [ ] Build real-world example datasets
- [ ] Include failure mode testing scenarios

**Progress**: ⚪ 0% Complete

## 📋 Phase 5: Systematic Testing & Iteration (Week 4)

### 5.1 A/B Testing Pipeline
- [ ] Automated prompt comparison across templates
- [ ] Performance benchmarking (accuracy, speed, cost)
- [ ] Statistical significance testing
- [ ] Results tracking and visualization

### 5.2 Continuous Improvement Loop
- [ ] Run evaluations across prompt variants
- [ ] Analyze failure modes and edge cases
- [ ] Refine prompts based on data insights
- [ ] Re-test and validate improvements
- [ ] Document learnings and best practices

**Progress**: ⚪ 0% Complete
